## Anomaly Details

### 1. High Disk Usage
- **Severity Level**: Medium
- **Possible Root Cause**: The disk usage is at 78.7%, which is relatively high and could be due to large files, logs, or backups consuming space. Regular monitoring and cleanup may be necessary.

### 2. Multiple Network Interfaces Down
- **Severity Level**: High
- **Possible Root Cause**: Several network interfaces (Ethernet, Ethernet 2, Bluetooth Network Connection 2, Local Area Connection* 11, Local Area Connection* 12) are down. This could be due to hardware issues, misconfiguration, or network cable problems. Immediate investigation is required to restore network connectivity.

### 3. High Latency to trigent.com
- **Severity Level**: High
- **Possible Root Cause**: The latency to trigent.com is significantly higher (157.67ms) compared to other destinations. This could be due to network congestion, routing issues, or problems on the trigent.com server side. Further network diagnostics and traceroute analysis are recommended to identify the specific cause.

### 4. CPU Usage
- **Severity Level**: Low
- **Possible Root Cause**: The CPU usage is at 76.1%, which is within acceptable limits but should be monitored to ensure it does not reach critical levels. Potential causes could include running multiple applications or processes that are consuming CPU resources.

### 5. Memory Usage
- **Severity Level**: Low
- **Possible Root Cause**: The memory usage is at 65.0%, which is within acceptable limits but should be monitored to ensure it does not reach critical levels. Potential causes could include running multiple applications or processes that are consuming memory resources.

### 6. Network Usage
- **Severity Level**: Low
- **Possible Root Cause**: The network usage shows a significant amount of data received (1556.49 MB) compared to data sent (437.72 MB). This could be due to downloading large files or streaming services. Regular monitoring of network usage is recommended to identify any unusual patterns.

### 7. Interface 'Wi-Fi 2' Speed
- **Severity Level**: Low
- **Possible Root Cause**: The speed of the 'Wi-Fi 2' interface is 200Mbps, which is lower than the maximum possible speed for Wi-Fi networks. This could be due to distance from the router, interference, or limitations of the Wi-Fi hardware. Adjusting the router placement or upgrading hardware may help improve speed.

### 8. Latency to 1.1.1.1
- **Severity Level**: Medium
- **Possible Root Cause**: The latency to 1.1.1.1 is 13.33ms with a jitter of 11.0ms, which indicates some network instability. This could be due to network congestion, routing issues, or interference. Further network diagnostics are recommended to identify the specific cause.

## Suggested Actions
1. **Disk Usage**: Perform regular disk space monitoring and cleanup to prevent high disk usage.
2. **Network Interfaces**: Investigate and resolve hardware issues, misconfiguration, or network cable problems causing network interfaces to be down.
3. **Latency to trigent.com**: Conduct network diagnostics and traceroute analysis to identify and resolve the cause of high latency.
4. **CPU Usage**: Monitor CPU usage continuously and manage running applications to prevent reaching critical levels.
5. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage continuously and manage running applications to prevent reaching critical levels.
6. **Network Usage**: Regularly monitor network usage to detect and address unusual patterns.
7. **Wi-Fi Speed**: Adjust router placement or upgrade Wi-Fi hardware to improve network speed.
8. **Latency to 1.1.1.1**: Conduct further network diagnostics to identify and resolve the cause of network instability.
